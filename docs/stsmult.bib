	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for automatic recognition of cancerous tissues from an image of a microscopic section. Based on the shape and the size analysis of the observed cells, this method provides the physician with nonsubjective numerical values for four criteria of malignancy. This automatic approach is based on mathematicalmorphology, and more specifically on the use of Geodesy. This technique is used first to remove the background noise from the image and then to operate a segmentation of the nuclei of the cells and an analysis of their shape, their size and their texture. From the values of the extracted criteria, an automatic classification of the image (cancerous or not) is finally operated.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in microcopy and improvements in image processing algorithms have allowed the development of computer-assisted analytical approaches in cell identification. Several applications could be mentioned in this field: Cellular phenotype identification, disease detection and treatment, identifying virus entry in cells and virus classification; these applications could help to complement the opinion of medical experts. Although many surveys have been presented in medical image analysis, they focus mainly in tissues and organs and none of the surveys about image cells consider an analysis following the stages in the typical image processing: Segmentation, feature extraction and classification. The goal of this study is to provide comprehensive and critical analyses about the trends in each stage of cell image processing. In this paper, we present a literature survey about cell identification using different image processing techniques.},

	abstract = {Cytology is a low-cost and non-invasive diagnostic procedure employed to support the diagnosis of a broad range of pathologies. Cells are harvested from tissues by aspiration or scraping, and it is still predominantly performed manually by medical or laboratory professionals extensively trained for this purpose. It is a time-consuming and repetitive process where many diagnostic criteria are subjective and vulnerable to human interpretation. Com­ puter Vision technologies, by automatically generating quantitative and objective descriptions of examinations’ contents, can help minimize the chances of misdiagnoses and shorten the time required for analysis. To identify the state-of-art of computer vision techniques currently applied to cytology, we conducted a Systematic Liter­ ature Review, searching for approaches for the segmentation, detection, quantification, and classification of cells and organelles using computer vision on cytology slides. We analyzed papers published in the last 4 years. The initial search was executed in September 2020 and resulted in 431 articles. After applying the inclusion/ exclusion criteria, 157 papers remained, which we analyzed to build a picture of the tendencies and problems present in this research area, highlighting the computer vision methods, staining techniques, evaluation metrics, and the availability of the used datasets and computer code. As a result, we identified that the most used methods in the analyzed works are deep learning-based (70 papers), while fewer works employ classic computer vision only (101 papers). The most recurrent metric used for classification and object detection was the accuracy (33 papers and 5 papers), while for segmentation it was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (38 papers). Regarding staining techniques, Papanicolaou was the most employed one (130 papers), followed by H\&E (20 papers) and Feulgen (5 papers). Twelve of the datasets used in the papers are publicly available, with the {DTU}/Herlev dataset being the most used one. We conclude that there still is a lack of high-quality datasets for many types of stains and most of the works are not mature enough to be applied in a daily clinical diagnostic routine. We also identified a growing tendency towards adopting deep learning-based approaches as the methods of choice.},
